information:

I am a Software Engineer working in IT since 2007 and I am working as a consultant and developer at UruIT since April 2012. Since then I have worked mostly in projects related with Data Analytics until the past year when I started a post-degree related to Artificial Intelligence which opened me the doors of some cool Machine Learning projects, mainly solving challenging computer vision problems for a video analytic platform.

 As a plus I have worked in college since 2013 as a programming teacher, working with students on their first steps in the system careers which has been challenging but also a very enriching experience among these years.
